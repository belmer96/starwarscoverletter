			<p>
				It is a time of opportunity.
			</p>
			<p>
				A powerful Engineer Jedi, Blake, has emerged as a true force to be reckoned with. 	
			</p>
			<p>
				Despite not holding a software engineering degree he is no padawan. Blake possesses a mechanical engineering degree. Blake has the ability to navigate the complexities of the software side of technology from self learning.
				The lack of a traditional software engineering degree, has been no match for Blake's problem-solving abilities, their force is powerful enough to overcome many obstacles.
			</p>
			<p>
				When tasked with a difficult problem Blake is very resourceful and not afraid to ask questions.  He will admit he used github and chatgpt to help create this intro.  Nonetheless he hopes whoever is reading this might have enjoyed a good snicker.	
			</p>

				As Blake continues on their journey, they seek to join a respected organization and use their skills and experience to make a lasting impact in the software side of technology, the choice is yours to join the light or fall to the dark side, but with Blake, the force will always be strong...
